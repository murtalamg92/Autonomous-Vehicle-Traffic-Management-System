# Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle (DAV) Traffic Management System

A blockchain-based platform for coordinating autonomous vehicle traffic, emergency response, and infrastructure maintenance through smart contracts.

## Overview

The DAV Traffic Management System is a decentralized solution that enables autonomous vehicles to interact with traffic infrastructure and each other while maintaining safety, efficiency, and transparency. The system uses blockchain technology to ensure secure communication and coordinate complex traffic patterns in real-time.

## Core Components

### Vehicle Registration Contract
- Manages unique digital identities for autonomous vehicles
- Validates vehicle credentials and operational status
- Tracks vehicle maintenance and inspection records
- Handles registration updates and renewals
- Maintains compliance with regulatory requirements

### Traffic Flow Contract
- Implements real-time traffic optimization algorithms
- Coordinates vehicle routing and speed recommendations
- Manages intersection timing and access
- Handles congestion detection and mitigation
- Provides route optimization based on current conditions

### Accident Response Contract
- Detects and verifies accident occurrences
- Coordinates emergency service dispatch
- Manages traffic rerouting around incidents
- Records incident data for analysis
- Facilitates automated insurance claim initiation

### Infrastructure Maintenance Contract
- Monitors road usage patterns and wear
- Schedules predictive maintenance
- Coordinates maintenance crew deployment
- Tracks repair history and costs
- Optimizes resource allocation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- Hardhat Development Environment
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to an Ethereum network
- GPS and telemetry integration capabilities

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dav-traffic-system.git

# Install dependencies
cd dav-traffic-system
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration
1. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
    - `NETWORK_ENDPOINT`: Blockchain network connection
    - `ORACLE_API_KEY`: Traffic data oracle access
    - `EMERGENCY_SERVICES_API`: Emergency response integration
    - `MAINTENANCE_SYSTEM_KEY`: Infrastructure management access

2. Set system parameters in `config.js`:
    - Vehicle registration requirements
    - Traffic flow thresholds
    - Emergency response protocols
    - Maintenance scheduling rules

## Usage

### Vehicle Registration
```javascript
// Example of registering a new vehicle
await vehicleRegistry.registerVehicle(
    vehicleId,
    manufacturerData,
    safetyFeatures,
    ownerCredentials
);
```

### Traffic Management
```javascript
// Example of requesting optimal route
await trafficFlow.requestRoute(
    vehicleId,
    currentLocation,
    destination,
    preferenceSettings
);
```

### Emergency Response
```javascript
// Example of reporting an incident
await accidentResponse.reportIncident(
    location,
    incidentType,
    vehiclesInvolved,
    severityLevel
);
```

### Maintenance Operations
```javascript
// Example of scheduling maintenance
await infrastructureMaintenance.scheduleRepair(
    roadSegment,
    maintenanceType,
    priority,
    estimatedDuration
);
```

## System Architecture
